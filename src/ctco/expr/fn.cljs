;; Defines the Fn and FnBody record types for representing 'fn'
;; expressions in the Clojure TCO compiler. The Fn record stores the
;; (optional) name field for an 'fn' expression as well as a set of
;; FnBody records. The FnBody record represents clauses in 'fn'
;; expressions. That is, a given Fn record contains one FnBody record
;; for each overloaded arity of a source-level 'fn' expression.
;;
;; FnBody implements the following protocols:
;;
;;      PCpsTriv:
;;              Applies the CPS transformation to the body expression
;;              and extends the formal parameters list with an
;;              additional 'k' argument for the continuation.
;;
;;              The current implementation returns a function that takes
;;              the symbol used to denote the continuation
;;              argument. This makes the CPS transformation for Fn
;;              easier because it allows for easy reuse of the last
;;              argument for function bodies whose original arities
;;              conflict with the CPS arity of another function body by
;;              allowing the symbol for the final argument to be passed
;;              in. This prevents the need for alpha-renaming the
;;              resulting expression or inserting a 'let' expression in
;;              the generated code to bind the continuation variable
;;              name to the value of the final argument. See the
;;              implementation notes for PCpsTriv/cps-triv for the Fn
;;              record type for more details.
;;
;;      PUnparse:
;;              Unparses (recursively) the syntax for the expression as
;;              `(~fml* ~cmap? ~bexpr*).
;;
;;      PWalkable:
;;              Applies the given function to each body expression,
;;              returning a new FnBody record with the results, along
;;              with the original formals list and condition map.
;;
;; Fn implements the following protocols:
;;
;;      PCpsTriv:
;;              Applies the Davny-style first-order one-pass CPS
;;              algorithm to each FnBody (function body) via the
;;              cps-triv function, which returns a function that takes
;;              the representation for the variable associated with the
;;              continuation argument.
;;
;;              It also inserts new FnBody expressions which allow for
;;              "backwards-compatible" calls to the transformed 'fn'
;;              expression. That is, a body which will initiate the
;;              trampoline computation with the empty continuation so
;;              that code that is not transformed via CTCO can make
;;              procedure calls to functions that are transformed. If
;;              the source-level expression did not include a name for
;;              the 'fn' expression, a unique name is inserted to allow
;;              for the recursive call.
;;
;;              In the case of a FnBody whose CPS arity is unique, the
;;              function returned from cps-triv receives a unique
;;              variable.
;;
;;              In the case of a FnBody whose CPS arity conflicts with
;;              the arity of another FnBody (i.e. the source-level 'fn'
;;              expression was overloaded such that it had arities n and
;;              n+1), the returned function is passed the representation
;;              of the symbol for the last argument of the FnBody whose
;;              arity conflicts with it. The FnBody for the CPS version
;;              of the first FnBody and the one for the
;;              backwards-compatible call to the next one are merged by
;;              inserting an 'if' expression that executes the CPS code
;;              if the last argument is a contination (see cont.clj for
;;              how continuations are typed at runtime) and makes the
;;              initial trampoline call to the next FnBody otherwise.
;;
;;              Note that the algorithm presented here is thought to be
;;              its first implementation, having been devised for CTCO.
;;
;;      PUnparse:
;;              Unparses (recursively) the expression as
;;              `(fn ~name? ~bexpr*)
;;
;;      PWalkable:
;;              Applies the given function to each FnBody, returning a
;;              new Fn with the results and the same name.
;;
;; FnBody and Fn have the same implementations for the following
;; protocols:
;;
;;      PLoadTrampoline:
;;              Applies load-tramp to each subexpression (with the given
;;              trampoline function name) and returns a new FnBody or Fn
;;              using the walk-expr function provided by PWalkable.
;;
;;      PThunkify:
;;              Applies thunkify to each subexpression and returns a new
;;              FnBody or Fn using the walk-expr function provided by
;;              PWalkable.
