;; Includes the protocols used in the CTCO compiler. These include the
;; following:
;;
;; PCpsSrs:
;;      Implemented by expressions which can undergo a CPS
;;      transformation and are considered "serious." As a rule of
;;      thumb, "serious" expressions are either function application
;;      or expressions that include a function application as a
;;      subexpression.
;;
;; PCpsTriv:
;;      Implemented by expressions which can undergo a CPS
;;      transformation and are considered "trivial." As a rule of
;;      thumb, this includes simple expressions (numbers, booleans,
;;      etc.) and non-function application expressions that contain
;;      no serious subexpressions.
;;
;; PLoadTrampoline:
;;      Compiler pass for loading appropriate expressions onto the
;;      trampoline. Currently this only includes expressions marked by
;;      the TrampMark reccord, which indicate the "compatibility" bodies
;;      for 'fn' expressions. That is, function bodies which are
;;      produced to allow non-CTCO code to call into functions
;;      transformed by CTCO.
;;
;; PThunkify:
;;      Implemented by expressions for "thunkification," or the
;;      process of ensuring a recursive function periodically returns
;;      a function of no arguments, the basis for trampolining.
;;
;; PUnparse:
;;      Implemented by expressions that need to be unparseed as code
;;      from the intermediate representation used in CTCO.
;;
;; PWalkable:
;;      Implemented by expressions for which a new expression needs to
;;      be created by applying a function to each of its
;;      subexpressions. This can be thought of as "map" for
;;      heterogeneously-shaped expressions. It's also generally only
;;      used internally for limiting code copying for expression
;;      traversals in CTCO passes.
